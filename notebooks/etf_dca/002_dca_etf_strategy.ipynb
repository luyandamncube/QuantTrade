    "\n",
    "This chart visualizes the **intraday 1-minute price action** of each ETF (SPY, QQQ, SPLV, SHY) relative to its **long-term 200-day moving average (MA)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the most recent intraday prices (1-minute resolution)\n",
    "2. Load the latest 200-day moving average from daily data\n",
    "3. Plot both on the same chart for comparison\n",
    "4. Indicate whether it's a good day to invest (i.e. price above 200-day MA)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **200-day MA** serves as a trend-following filter:\n",
    "- When **price is above** the 200-day MA, the asset is considered to be in a long-term **uptrend**.\n",
    "- When **price is below** the 200-day MA, it signals a potential **downtrend or weakness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Allocation Rules:\n",
    "- **If SPY is above its 200-day MA** → Allow contribution to SPY this month.\n",
    "- **If SPY is below its 200-day MA** → Redirect SPY contribution to SPLV (or SHY).\n",
    "- **If QQQ is above its 200-day MA** → Allow contribution to QQQ this month.\n",
    "- **If QQQ is below its 200-day MA** → Redirect QQQ contribution to SPLV (or SHY).\n",
    "- **If both SPY and QQQ are below their 200-day MAs** → Go fully defensive: allocate entire amount to SPLV or SHY, depending on which is above its MA.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🕒 Why Intraday View?\n",
    "Markets often gap or trend early in the session. Checking current price against the 200-day MA on a **1-minute basis** just before execution (e.g., around 10:00 AM ET) lets us make precise and **rule-based allocation decisions** on the day of purchase.\n"
